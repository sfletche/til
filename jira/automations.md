TIL about JIRA Automations

Automations are Rules that can be triggered by JIRA actions.

Examples might include... 
* Closing a parent ticket when all sub-tasks are complete
* Re-calculating a parent field when related fields are updated in sub-tasks (e.g. aggregating story points)
* Marking parent ticket as Done when all sub-tasks have been transitioned to Done
* etc
