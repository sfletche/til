Today I learned about `git reset --mixed` and how it differs from `git reset --hard` and `git reset --soft`...

Given the following commit history on `master`
A -> B -> C 

`git reset --mixed B` (NOTE: `--mixed` is the default option for `reset`)
`HEAD`, `master`, and the index all point to `B` (changes to `C` persist in the working directory but are not staged)
(Running `git commit` at this point, will do nothing, as those changes made to `C` are not staged)

`git reset --soft B`
`HEAD` and `master` now point to `B`, while the index (staged files in working directory) contains changes from `C`
(Running `git commit` at this point, will produce a new commit identical to `C`)

`git reset --hard B`
`HEAD`, `master`, and the index now point to `B` and none of the changes made to `C` are persisted in your working directory
