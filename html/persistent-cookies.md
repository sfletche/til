Today I learned about *persistent* vs *non-persistent* cookies.

Specifying an expiration date allows the cookie to persist across sessions, until that date is reached.
*Persistent cookies* remain until the expiration date is reached.

When setting a cookie, if no expiration date is specified, the cookie is removed when the user closes their browser.  
*Non-persistent cookies* lack an expiration date.
