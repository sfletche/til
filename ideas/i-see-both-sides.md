I recently listened to a podcast (which may have been Reply All? or maybe Invisibilia?)
in which a reporter visited the Dallas police shootings (or maybe the Baton Rouge police shootings?)
and noticed many people just sort of hanging out around the multi-block crime scene.  

The reporter approached one of these people and their conversation steered toward the lines of division between so many people right now.

Their conversation eventually led to the following quote,

"I see both sides... but whenever you say you see one side everyone thinks you hate the other side, so I just stay quiet."

This is what the conversations on the internet don't show us.  The voice of the silent majority.
