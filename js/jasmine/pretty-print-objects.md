Often when a jasmine test fails comparing objects, the output is not easily parsed...
(i.e. one stringified object next to another stringified object).

Today I learned that Jasmine has a pretty print functionality that can be overridden 
making the output generated by the failing test easier to read.

Just add the following to the top of your file, to override the pretty printing!

```
jasmine.pp = function(obj) {
  return JSON.stringify(obj, undefined, 2);
};
```
