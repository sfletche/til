For months I've been dealing with an out of date auto-complete suggestion from chrome.

You know the drill...

1. cmd-t
1. type a couple characters 
1. hit <enter>

Which for the last couple months was painfully followed by...

4. cmd-l
5. right arrow
6. option-shift-left-arrow to highlight and delete the bits that are out of date and replace them with an up to date url

Today I learned how to remove an item from Chrome's auto-complete list  :)

1. cmd-t 
1. type the same couple characters
1. down arrow to highlight the auto-complete you want to remove
1. remove the entry via shift-fn-delete
1. repeat until the desired auto-complete is on top

viola.  my life is improved.   :)
