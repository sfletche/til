Today I read an article today by Benjamin Mathes titled 
[How to Listen When You Disagree: A Lesson from the Republican National Convention](http://urbanconfessional.org/blog/howtodisagree)

In the article, the author describes his strategy when confronted with a point of view we disagree with.

He suggests asking one question,

**"Will you tell me your story?  I'd love to know how you came to this point of view"**

and then listen to their reponse.

He closes with "In the end it's the people we need to love, not their opinions."
