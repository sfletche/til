Today I learned about `babel-preset-list`

`npm install babel-preset-list`

from the command line

```
$ babel-preset-list
  Select package (Use arrow keys)
  es2015
  es2016
  es2017
  latest
  stage-0
  stage-1
> stage-2
  stage-3
```

```
  Select package stage-2
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-stage-2
  {
    "presets": [
      "babel-preset-stage-3"
    ],
    "plugins": [
      "babel-plugin-transform-class-properties",
      "babel-plugin-transform-decorators"
    ] 
  }
```

voila  :)
