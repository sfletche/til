After listening to Kyle Simpson of [You don't know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) fame recommend this presentation while on [Javasript Jabber](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/220-jsj-teaching-javascript-with-kyle-simpson) recently,  I watched / listened to 
[The Politics of Javascript](https://speakerdeck.com/anguscroll/the-politics-of-javascript) by Angus Croll (see [here](http://blog.anguscroll.com/) and [here](https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/])).

With so many ways to do almost everything in JS, it's no wonder that so many arguments over best practices (and "good parts") have arisen. 
Angus adds a welcomed dose of reason to all the back and forth within the community 
and suggests that with a little bit of effort in understanding the language we can all rise above the tribalism of the idealogues.

I enjoyed the talk so much, I just ordered a copy of his book [If Hemingway Wrote Javascript](http://anguscroll.com/hemingway/).  :)
