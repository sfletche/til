Haven't done this in so long, I forgot how...adding here to help me remember for next time...

Adding aliases to `~/.bashrc`

```
vi ~/.bashrc
```
add the following
```
alias g='git'
```
save, quit, and reload `bashrc` (bash run commands)
```
. ~/.bashrc
```
Now you should be able to use the aliases e.g.
```
g pull
```
