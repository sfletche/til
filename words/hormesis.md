Hormesis

Def. favorable response to a low dose of an agent or stressor, e.g. sunlight or exercise, that has a detrimental effect at higher doses

It can be argued that the immune system is a hormetic system, in which the stressor is an antigen.
This understanding underlies the principle of vaccination, which results in increased tolerance to foreign agents such viruses.

Strength training is another example of hormesis. 
You place your body under controlled stress, rest it adequately, and it responds by growing muscle.
