Today I learned I can get the `curl` request from the Chrome Dev Tools.  

While painfully constructing a `curl` request to add to a bug report, a colleague happened by my desk and asked me
why I wasn't just getting the `curl` from the dev tools...to which I responded, 'wha???'  

1. Popped open the dev tools.  
1. Selected the Network tab.
1. Right-clicked on the request I want the curl for.
1. Select `Copy as cURL`.

DevTools for the win!
