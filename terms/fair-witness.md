Fair Witness
from Robert Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land...

A fair witness is an individual trained to observe events 
and report exactly what he or she sees and hears, 
making no extrapolations or assumptions.

The act of reporting obervations as literally as possible, 
without conclusions or assumptions.
