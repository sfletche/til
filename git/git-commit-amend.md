Can't believe I hadn't heard about this until now...

So you've just made a commit and realized you forgot to add unstaged files...?

```
git add .
git commit --amend
```

Maybe you've just made a commit and want to improve the commit message...?

```
git commit --amend
```

Note: not a good idea for previously published / shared commits (unless you're on a team of 1)
